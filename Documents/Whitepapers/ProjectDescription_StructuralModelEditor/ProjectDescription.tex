\begin{abstract}
  \CADENA\ is based on a component oriented programming
  paradigm. Components are software artifacts that form the primary
  building blocks of a system (comparable to objects in object
  oriented programming), they are defined by their interfaces and can
  be easily plugged together or interchanged. Component diagrams
  specify how various components interact within a larger system. The
  structural modeling tools in \CADENA\ should allow for designing
  component diagram styles, creating components, and assembling the
  components into scenarios.

  In this project, we will use the graph editing features in eclipse
  to build a three tier component graph creation and editing feature
  for \CADENA.

\begin{abstract}
  A major advantage of model driven development is that the ``code''
  (\emph{i.\,e.}, the models) are abstract enough to easily introduce
  well established formal verification procedures without much
  preprocessing. This project will enable model checking on the given
  behavioral models.

  In this project, we will build a translator for the given behavioral
  description in \CADENA\ into the input syntax of a well known
  model-cheking tool. Infrastructure to automatically run the model
  checker is required, editing support or backwards translation would
  be a bonus.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  The original \textsc{Cadena} featured only structural
  modeling. However, a generic, abstract, behavioral specification in
  form of activity graphs will mark an important step towards pure
  model driven development (where actual coding can be reduced to a
  minimum or even eliminated). In this project, graph-based and
  form-based editors for behavioral modeling based on lightweight
  process coordination will be implemented.
